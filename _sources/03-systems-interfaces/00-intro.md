# How Computers Work (Part 2): Operating Systems & Interfaces

This chapter covers a variety of topics related to how computers "work," with a focus on operating systems and computer interfaces. 

One goal for this chapter is to help you gain an understanding of how the operating system and other software applications interact with the underlying hardware, focusing on common core operating system tasks. 

Finally, this chapter introduces the concept of a command-line interface and provides a foundation for navigating the machine using the shell.
