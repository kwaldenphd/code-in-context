To launch the terminal...

Mac:
- By default, the shell is located in `Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal`

Windows:
- Run Git Bash from the directory that you installed it in. You will have to run it as an administrator - to do so, right click on the program and select 'Run as Administrator.'

When the terminal or shell is running, you will see a window that looks similar to the image above.

For Mac users who want to customize the terminal's visual appearance:
- Open the `Settings` menu (in `Preferences`, under `Terminal`)
- Click the `Settings` tab to change the color scheme

Windows users can right-click on the application's top bar and select `Properties` to open the `Properties` tab.
