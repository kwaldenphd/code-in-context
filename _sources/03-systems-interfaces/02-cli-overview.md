# The Command Line Interface

The usual way that computer users today interact with their system is through a Graphical-User Interface, or GUI (*pronounced "gooey" or "G-U-I"*). This means that when you go into a folder, you click on a picture of a file folder; when you run a program, you click on it; and when you browse the web, you use your mouse to interact with various elements on a webpage. Before the rise of GUIs as a central part of personal computer operating systems in the late 1980s, however, the primary way to interact with a computer was through a command-line interface (CLI).

Command-line interfaces allow for more detail when running some programs, because you can add modifiers to specify exactly how you want your program to run. They can be easily automated through scripts, which are essentially recipes of text-based commands.

There are two main command-line interfaces, or "shells." On Mac OS or many Linux installations, the shell is known as `bash`, or the ‘Bourne-again shell.’ For users on Windows-based systems, the command-line interface is by default `MS-DOS-based`, which uses different commands and syntax, but can often achieve similar tasks. This tutorial provides a basic introduction to the `bash` terminal, and Windows users can follow along by installing popular shells such as Cygwin or Git Bash.

## Setup

For Mac users (and most Linux installations), you’re in luck — you already have a bash shell installed. 

Windows users will need to take one extra step and install Git Bash.
