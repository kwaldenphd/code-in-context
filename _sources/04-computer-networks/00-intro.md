# Computer Networks & the Internet

This chapter provides an introduction to core concepts in computer networking, with a focus on the building blocks that facilitate information sharing and communication. It covers packet switching, protocols, addressing, and routing, and also provides a starting point for thinking about what "the internet" is and how it is organized.

Framing questions:
- How does each author talk about computer networks? What are they, how do they work, and what do they do?
  * Conceptually, functionally, technically, socially, politically, etc
- What is the chapter's specific historical, cultural & political context?
- After reading the chapter...
  * What is a network? Why does it matter how computers talk to each other?
  * What questions do we need to be asking or steps we need to be taking around computer networks to build more just, equitable, inclusive systems?
