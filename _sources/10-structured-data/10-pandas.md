Some of you may be wondering why we are talking about pandas in a computing course...

Panda: "a large black-and-white mammal (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) of chiefly central China that feeds primarily on bamboo shoots and is now usually classified with the bears (family Ursidae)" ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/panda))

Wait that's not right....

`pandas`: "a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language" ([`pandas` documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/))

That makes more sense.

## Background

At its core, "`pandas` is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)). The name `pandas` is derived from "panel data," an econometrics term used to describe particular types of datasets. The name `pandas` is also a play on "Python data analysis."

Using Python's built-in `csv` and `json` modules to work with structured data (especially large amounts of data) can be cumbersome and limiting. Since it first launched in 2008, `pandas` has become a mainstay in Python data analysis workflows.
