# Well-Formed HTML

This is a very basic HTML document. The HTML tags `<HTML>` identify this document as a html document. The body tags `<body>` enclose the content that will be visible on the page. You should see just the text “Hello World!” The browser has translated the HTML tags and returned only the text.

`hello-world.html` contains the minimum requirements for an HTML document. However, it is best practice to create a HTML document that is “well formed,” that is, that it follows all of the grammar, vocabulary, and syntax rules of html. We can check the well-formed-ness of this document in a validator like the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org). 

Head to the W3C validator and click on “Validate by Direct Input” and copy and paste the code above into the validator and click `check`. You should receive a few errors.

- [W3Schools, "HTML !DOCTYPE Declaration"](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp)
- [W3Schools, "HTML ISO Language Codes"](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp)
  
HTML is pretty forgiving, but other languages are not, so it’s best to practice following all of the rules from the start.
