# Additional Pages

We have just created is a single web page. To build a web site, we likely want multiple pages of linked content. 

```{image} ../images/ch5/Fig_L.png
:alt: Second Page
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

Letâ€™s add a second `.html` file in the same folder as `index.html`. Save this file as `page2.html`. 

We can copy the HTML from `index.html` to make sure we're starting with an HTML document that is well-formed and valid.

:alt: Second Page
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

Add some content to your second page, starting with a title, `<h1>` and `<p>` tags.
