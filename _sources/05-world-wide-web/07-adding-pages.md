# Additional Pages

We have just created is a single web page. To build a web site, we likely want multiple pages of linked content.

Letâ€™s add a second `.html` file in the same folder as `index.html`. Save this file as `page2.html`. 

We can copy the HTML from `index.html` to make sure we're starting with an HTML document that is well-formed and valid.

Add some content to your second page, starting with a title, `<h1>` and `<p>` tags.
