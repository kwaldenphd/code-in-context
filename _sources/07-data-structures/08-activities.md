# Activities

The first group of collaborative activities give students opportunities to apply foundational Python concepts, using a madlib generator, a mascot guessing game, and color guessing game.

The second set of activities continue work with the [BBC Microbit](https://microbit.org/), a cost-effective physical computing device that includes an online block editor and Python libraries. Using the Microbit, students can build on their foundational programming knowledge to be better-equipped for the introduction of new programming concepts.
