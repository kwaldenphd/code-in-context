# Putting It All Together

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/python-data-structures/blob/main/images/Python_Array_Comparison.png?raw=true" width="500"></p>

Q7: Describe the five data structures covered in this lab (strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets) in your own words. How are they similar? What are key differences? What kinds of tasks/contexts/problems would benefit from specific structures?
- NOTE: You are welcome to include code as part of this answer, but a code component is not required.

For these last two questions, you can use any of the data structures and arguments/syntax presented in this lab. As part of your answer, include a brief explanation for why you choose a particular data structure for the task.

## Question 8

Q8: Write a program that asks a user to input their current or former Notre Dame residence hall and returns or outputs that hall's mascot ([link to table with list of halls and mascots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame_residence_halls#List)).

Sample output for this program:

```
Howard Hall's mascot is ducks!
```

Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code, as well as a brief explanation for the data structure/approach you chose for this program.

## Question 9

Q9: In a previous lab, you wrote a program that asks the user to enter a color value and returns an output message indicating whether the color is a primary, secondary, or tertiary color (using a combination of the `input()` function, comparison operators, `if-then-else` logic, and Boolean logical operators).

Primary colors:
- Red
- Yellow
- Blue

Secondary colors:
- Green
- Orange
- Purple

Tertiary colors:
- Amber
- Vermillion
- Magenta
- Violet
- Teal
- Chartreuse

Let's revisit and rewrite this program- how could you approach this task using the data structures and syntax presented in this lab?
