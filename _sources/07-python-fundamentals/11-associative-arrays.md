The other primary type of array we can encounter is an **associative array**, "an abstract data type that stores a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection" ([Wikpedia, Associative Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array))

We can imagine this type of data structure being useful when working with data that is connected or related to other pieces of information.
