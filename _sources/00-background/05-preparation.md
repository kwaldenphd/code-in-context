# Preparing for Class Meetings

Every instructor has different expectations around how you should prepare for class or engage with content assigned as part of the class.

## Topical Content 

Typically, we’ll engage with topical content during Tuesday class meetings. If you’re asked to read content, this involves actively reading the assigned material before the class meeting where we’ll be engaging with it. Active reading strategies can include annotating, summarizing, identifying thesis statements, etc.

- Prof. Walden will typically provide an overview or introduction to assigned content. This will often include some framing questions- these are good places to start as you read.
- These guidelines also apply for long-form content like podcasts or videos.

You’ll also see topical content that says “explore” or “skim” (instead of “read”). These are materials that Prof. Walden wants to incorporate in a class session, but not at the same level of depth as content you’re asked to read.
- The same active reading strategies can be useful, but focus on identifying key arguments and summarizing main points. You aren’t expected to ask detailed questions or provide in-depth analysis based on content that’s marked “explore” or “skim.”
- Typically “skim” is used for long-form pieces like articles, and “explore” is used for online resources (like websites).
- Prof. Walden will typically provide an overview or introduction to assigned content. This will often include some guidance for how to approach or engage material you’re asked to “skim” or “explore.”

## Guest Speakers

We’ll have a number of guest speakers throughout the semester. These guest speakers will typically introduce themselves, provide an introduction to their work, and leave time for conversation and questions.

Prof. Walden will typically provide an overview of guest speakers (or site visits) in a prior class meeting. She’ll often link to an online profile (personal website, ND web page, LinkedIn) where folks can go to learn more.

Preparation for guest speakers/site visits involves having a surface-level understanding of the guest and their work. Typically, you won’t be expected to do additional research or information gathering, beyond what’s covered in Prof. Walden’s preview. 

## Technical Content + Individual Application 

Typically, we’ll engage with technical content during Thursday class meetings. Preparation for the Thursday in-class collaborative work happens via individual application work that happens outside class. 

Prof. Walden has developed an open textbook that walks you through this individual work- including pre-recorded lectures, ungraded quizzes, tutorials, and application questions. She'll also typically provide an overview or introduction to the technical content and individual application (as well as Thursday class sessions). 

While individual application questions/problems typically aren’t due until end of day Friday, working through as much of the individual content as you can puts you in a good place to benefit from Thursday in-class work (and ask questions or get help before the deadline).
