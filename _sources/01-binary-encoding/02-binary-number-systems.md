## Key Concepts

```{admonition} Bits

"The bit is a basic unit of information in information theory, computing, including digital communications. As a binary digit, the bit represents a logical state, having only one of two values. It may be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either 0 or 1" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit))

**Bits**
- "The bit is a basic unit of information in information theory, computing, including digital communications. As a binary digit, the bit represents a logical state, having only one of two values. It may be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either 0 or 1" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit))

**Bytes**
- "The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte))

**Binary**
- "In mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ‘0’ (zero) and ‘1’ (one). The base-2 numeral system is a positional notation... Each digit is referred to as a bit. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary))

**Unit Conversions**
- Kilobyte KB = 1,000 Bytes 
- Megabyte MB = 1 million Bytes 
- Gigabyte GB = 1 billion Bytes 
- Terabyte TB = 1 trillion Bytes

**Pattern Ranges**
- One bit gives us two patterns: `1 and 0`. Two bits allow for four patterns: `00, 11, 01, 10`.
- Every time we add one bit to the length of our bitstring, we double the number of available patterns. So, 8 bits or 1 byte provides a means for representing 256 different patterns, as illustrated below:

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/bits-bytes/blob/main/images/Pattern_Ranges.png?raw=true" width="500"></p>

  * 1 bit – 2 patterns (21)
  * 2 bits – 4 (22)
  * 3 bits – 8 (23)
  * 4 bits – 16 (24)
  * 5 bits – 32 (25)
  * 6 bits – 64 (26)
  * 7 bits – 128 (27)
  * 8 bits – 256 (28)
  * n bits -  2n patterns
