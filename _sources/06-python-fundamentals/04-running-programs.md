# Running Your Program

Earlier in the semester, we wrote an assembly language program that ran when we pressed the `Execute` button.

In most programming languages, there are a few common options for how you run or execute specific lines of code, sections of code, or an entire program.

Most integrated development environments (IDEs) include two locations where you can execute code:
- We can type commands and run programs in the **console**, but those instructions are not saved and aren't available outside the current working session.
- We can also type commands and run programs in a **script**. This is a file that is saved as part of the project/workspace. It's available outside the current working session and can be reopened, modified, or executed (as an entire program).

A couple other notes on consoles and scripts:
- When we run a piece of code in our script, the output or result will be shown in the console.
- We can also run an entire script at the command line (i.e. `python main.py`)
