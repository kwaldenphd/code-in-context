# Collaborative Activities 

The first group of collaborative activities give students opportunities to apply foundational Python concepts, using a madlib generator, a coin change calculator, and an ASCII Art program.

The second set of activities introduce the [BBC Microbit](https://microbit.org/), a cost-effective physical computing device that includes an online block editor and Python libraries. Using the Microbit, students can build on their foundational programming knowledge to be better-equipped for the introduction of new programming concepts.

```{admonition} Discuss
:class: tip
In a previous chapter, we worked with HTML/CSS, and in this chapter we’re working in Python. As we’re starting more programming-intensive work, spend some time in your group, thinking about….
- How are folks experiencing programming so far? What is rewarding? What is challenging?
- What strategies or problem-solving approaches are folks finding helpful when you run into obstacles?
- Any preliminary thoughts on how different approaches to debugging and troubleshooting (including starting with pseudocode) might prove helpful?
