One of the Python IDE's we'll be exploring in this chapter does require a software download. Spyder is " a free and open source scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts" ([Spyder documentation](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)).

To install Spyder as a stand-alone program: [spyder-ide.org](https://www.spyder-ide.org)

The other Python IDE introduced in this chapter is the web-based Google Colaboratory.
