## Application Questions

Q1: Write a program that asks a user to enter a color value and returns an output message comparing that value with your favorite color. This program will use a combination of the `input()` function, comparison operators, and `if-then-else` logic. Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

Sample output for this program:
```
Your favorite color: green

My age: blue

We don't have the same favorite color.
```

Q2: Write a program that lets the user play a guessing game.
- First, your program should set a number as the "correct answer"
- Then, your program will ask the user to guess a number
- Your program should give a message indicating whether the user's guess is correct, too high, or too low

This program will use a combination of the `input()` function, comparison operators, and `if-then-else` logic. Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

Sample output for this program (for a correct answer of 7:

```
You guessed 13.

This guess is too high.

Better luck next time!
