## Application Questions

Q5: Let's return to the previous question's program. How would you modify your program to use a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop? Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

As a reminder, your output might look like the following:

```
1 Python
2 Python
3 Python
4 Python
5 Python
6 Python
7 Python
8 Python
9 Python
IS FUN!
```

Q6: An earlier application question asked you to modify the program below to search for the characters `q` and `u` in the string `turquoise`.

```Python
# assign string variable
color = "turquoise"

# get index number of t character
index_number = color.index("t")

# show index number as part of print statement
print ("The index number for the letter t within the word " + color + " is " + index_number)
```

Write a program that uses a `for` loop to return all instances of `q` and `u` in the string, not just the first occurrence. Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.
