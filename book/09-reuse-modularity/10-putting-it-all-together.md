# Putting It All Together

Using functions to promote modular programming serves a few key purposes:
- Yields **more concise code*** by eliminating the need to write out code for the same task multiple times
- Improves **improve code readability**
- Helps us **more effectively test and debug code**
  * Because we are creating reusable pieces or building blocks of code, we can more readily pinpoint where things are going wrong or not working in our code.
- **Promotes code reuse and modularity** by allowing us to define and call functions for common tasks

This may seem overly-complicated for a relatively simple program.

But imagine all kinds of more complex tasks we might want to accomplish in a programming environment- analyzing data, generating visualizations, creating textures, building interaction objects, etc. All of that becomes possible through functions- modular building blocks that can be combined to accomplish more complex tasks.
