# Built-In Functions

We have actually already been working with a number of Python's built-in functions. These include `print()`, `dict()`, `input()`, `int()`, and `len()`.

We call built-in functions using the function name, followed by parenthesis.
- `print()`
- `dict()`
- `input()`
- `int()`
- `len()`

When we call one of these built-in functions, Python accesses and then executes the funtion's source code stored elsewhere in the Python environment.
- For example, you can see the source code for the `print()` function, contained in [bltinmodule.c](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Python/bltinmodule.c#L1972) file in Python's [source code](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/).

Using `print()` as an example:
- The function definition is contained elsewhere in Python's source code
- We call the function using its name `print()`
- We pass some kind of input to the function (i.e. `print("Hello world")`)
- Some functions have an output or return value
