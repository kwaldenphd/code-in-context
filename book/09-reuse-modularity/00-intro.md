# Code Reuse & Modularity in Python

We've previously been introduced to the concept of **code blocks**. From Busbee and Braunschweig's "[Code Blocks](https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/code-blocks/)" from *Programming Fundamentals*:
- "A code block, sometimes referred to as a compound statement, is a lexical structure of source code which is grouped together. Blocks consist of one or more declarations and statements. A programming language that permits the creation of blocks, including blocks nested within other blocks, is called a block-structured programming language. Blocks are fundamental to structured programming, where control structures are formed from blocks."
   
Approaching a program as a series of components that each accomplish tasks that are part of the larger workflow gets us to a new concept: **modularity** or **modular programming**

From Busbee and Braunschweig's "[Modular Programming](https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/modular-programming/)," in *Programming Fundamentals*:
- "Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality."

Code blocks are one way to think about these discrete parts of a program. A more precise term used in programming languages is **function.** "Functions are important because they allow us to take large complicated programs and to divide them into smaller manageable pieces. Because the function is a smaller piece of the overall program, we can concentrate on what we want it to do and test it to make sure it works properly" (Busbee and Braunschweig, [Modular Programming](https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/modular-programming/)).
