# Functions in Python

In Python, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation.
- Key term: *function*

To execute a function, we call it by name and pass it an appropriate set of input arguments. A function takes zero or more arguments as inputs and returns zero or more outputs as a result. The output or result of a function is called the return value.
- Key terms: *function call*, *input argument*, *function output* or *return value*

Data, parameters, or arguments can be passed into a function. Functions can also return data.
