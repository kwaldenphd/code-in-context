# Programming Fundamentals in Python: Variables, Data Types & Operators

This chapter provides an overview of foundational programming concepts, with a focus on Python syntax. It also introduces two different Python IDEs- Spyder and Google Colaboratory.

Topics covered include:
- Variables & assignment operators
- Basic data types & comments
- Arithmetic operators
- Concatenation
- Input/Output
- Relational or comparison operators
- Boolean logic & logical operators

## <i class="fa-solid fa-gears" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Setup

One of the Python IDE's we'll be exploring in this chapter does require a software download. Spyder is " a free and open source scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts" ([Spyder documentation](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)).

To install Spyder as a stand-alone program: [spyder-ide.org](https://www.spyder-ide.org)

The other Python IDE introduced in this chapter is the web-based Google Colaboratory.

Framing questions:
- What do these authors say about what constitutes coding or programming? How does that compare or connect with your prior coding/programming experience?
  * Folks can be thinking about types of work, as well as the nature or character of that work.
- What do these authors say about who is a coder or programmer? How does that compare or connect with your prior coding/programming experience?
  * Folks can be thinking about individual people along with organizations or entities. It's also worth thinking about how particular structures or practices impact individual people (or groups of people).
- How do these authors describe or framing computing/programming history? 
  * Folks can be thinking about change over time and organizing principles. We can also be thinking about comparisons or connections with prior course conversations around computing history.
