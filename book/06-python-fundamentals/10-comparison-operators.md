# Comparison Operators

"The relational operators are often used to create a test expression that controls program flow. This type of expression is also known as a Boolean expression because they create a Boolean answer or value when evaluated. There are six common relational operators that give a Boolean value by comparing (showing the relationship) between two operands. If the operands are of different data types, implicit promotion occurs to convert the operands to the same data type" (Busbee, "[Relational Operators](https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/relational-operators/)", in *Programming Fundamentals*)

Relational operators, also called comparison operators, allow us to run `True/False` tests on specific conditions, focusing on the relationship(s) between two or more values.

Relational operators or comparison operators in Python:

<table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Syntax</th><th>Example</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Equal</td><td><code>==</code><td><code>x == y</code></td><td>Tests if values are equal</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Not equal</td><td><code>!=</code><td><code>x != y</code></td><td>Tests if values are not equal</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Greater than</td><td><code>></code><td><code>x > y</code></td><td>Tests is a value is greater than another</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Less than</td><td><code><</code><td><code>x < y</code></td><td>Tests is a value is less than another</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Greater than or equal to</td><td><code>>=</code><td><code>x >= y</code></td><td>Tests if a value is greater than or equal to another</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Less than or equal to</td><td><code><=</code><td><code>x <= y</code></td><td>Tests if a value is less than or equal to another</td></tr>  
  </table>
