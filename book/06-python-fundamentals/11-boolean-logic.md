# Boolean Logic

- "In mathematics and mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values true and false, usually denoted 1 and 0" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra))

We've talked previously about the Boolean data type. The underlying `True`/`False` logic lets us test for specific conditions and then specify how our code will execute based on the truth value for those conditional statements.

- "You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, `True` or `False`. When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer" ([W3Schools, Python Booleans](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_booleans.asp))
