**Arithmetic Logic Unit**
- "An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit))

**Memory**
- "In computing, memory refers to a device that is used to store information for immediate use in a computer or related computer hardware device" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory))

**Registers**
- "In computer architecture, a processor register is a quickly accessible location available to a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Registers usually consist of a small amount of fast storage" ([Wikpedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register))

**Random Access Memory (RAM)**
- "Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory))
- RAM is controlled by the CPU and can include data and instructions

**Persistent Memory**
- Physical storage (magnetic disks, solid state disks, magnetic tape, etc) that retains information even when the device is powered off

## Application

Q1: What types of inputs does the ALU accept? Or, what kind of data can be passed to the ALU?

Q2: What are some of the differences between RAM and persistent memory?
