# Scenarios

The three scenarios at the end of this chapter are designed to give additional practice and application with the computer architecture concepts covered earlier in the semester. 

Each uses an interactive Pep/9 simulator to apply concepts related to Von Neumann architecture, including data path, memory, and CPU/ALU operation.

Each scenario has its own set of application questions.
