# Application

Now it's your turn. The lab procedure has covered the tools you can use to get started, but you can also expand on what you've learned using the W3Schools HTML and CSS resources and documentation (be sure to cite resources you consult or reference- a list of URLs is fine). You're welcome to use or reuse the HTML/CSS content you created in the last section of the lab.

## Required Components 

For now, your site needs to fit a few minimum requirements. 

| Category | Requirement |
| :---: | :---: |
| Theme | Think of what you're building as a personal website that introduces you! You could focus on academics, hobbies, or clubs. You could focus on home, family, or pets. Up to you! |
| Landing Page | Build a landing page (`index.html`) that introduces you and provides a brief introduction to your site. |
| Additional Page | Your site needs at least one page (in addition to `index.html`). |
| Internal Link | At least one internal link (from `index.html` to your second page) |
| External Link | At least one external link (from a page on your site to another website) |
| Image | At least one image (on any page), with appropriate alt text |
| Table | At least one table (on any page) |
| Style & Formatting | CSS with at least 2 declarations that's used across your site pages (to standardize your site's look & feel) |

That’s it. You are free to be as creative as you’d like as long as you meet these requirements. As you design your site, the W3Schools [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/) and [CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) includes tutorials or sample code tutorials for menus, tables, and other elements you could add to your site. Feel free to borrow code and CSS you find on the web (be sure to provide a link back to sources). Have fun and experiment!
