# Web Search Activites

This set of activities focuses on web search, with opportunities for students to explore spectulative design in web search and learn more about content moderation. 

## Web Search Speculative Design 

We did a design exercise a few weeks ago- now is your chance to return to those questions and apply them to web search.


```{admonition} Discuss
In our content for this week and in-class discussion, we started to think about the cultural dimensions of web search. Spend some time in your group, thinking about….
- What would a web search that promotes transparency and equity and minimizes bias and harm look like? How would it take shape?
- What do we need to get there? Guardrails, safety measures, regulation, education, etc.
- Other comments on how you’re thinking about web search differently after engaging with this content
```

```{admonition} Design Prompts 
- **Users**: Who are some of the users for your system/interface and how will they access or interact with what you build? You can think about factors like age, location, specific devices, etc.

- **Functionality**: What are some of the core functions or tasks users will want or need to do with your system/interface? This could include things like file management, media rendering, etc.

- **Environmental Scan / Benchmarking**:  Who are you in conversation with -- are there other systems or interfaces that accomplish a similar set of tasks or core functions for a similar group of users?

- **Wireframing**: Start to develop a conceptual model for your system or interface. This could focus on a “desktop” or “home page.” You could also map out a couple key screens or components. You could also focus on a technical model of the interface as a system.

- **Reflection & Next Steps**: Take a step back and reflect on the group’s process and decisions. What were you able to accomplish? What feels unfinished, or what else would you think through given more time?

- **Additional Considerations**: We’ve had a few conversations around how we can move toward more equitable, inclusive tech systems. (How) does your interface or system acknowledge or address issues of inequality? What assumptions or choices went into your group’s thought process or choices?
