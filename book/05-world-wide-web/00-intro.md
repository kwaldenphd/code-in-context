# The World Wide Web

This chapter provides an introduction to HTML and CSS, the building blocks for much content and information available online. Additionally, it introduces the concept of an integrated development environment (IDE). Finally, it provides an opportunity to apply prior work with file management and directory structures.

Code.org, “[The Internet: How Search Works](https://youtu.be/LVV_93mBfSU)” *YouTube* (13 June 2017) *5 minutes*

Safiya Umoja Noble, “Introduction: The Power of Algorithms” from [Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism*](https://onesearch.library.nd.edu/permalink/f/1phik6l/ndu_aleph005505291) (New York University Press, 2018): 1-14.

Framing questions:
- How does Noble talk about the internet and web search?
  * What does the internet "do"? What (or who) is the internet "for"?
  * What "is" web search? How does it work and whose interests does it serve?
- How does Noble talk about "big tech"? What problems does she identify with the current landscape? What does she have to say about responsibility or accountability?

Once you've read the chapter...
- What is the internet “for”? How should we be thinking about what we want the internet to do or be?
- What are some of the things at stake in how web search functions? How should we be thinking about the cultural work web search does?
