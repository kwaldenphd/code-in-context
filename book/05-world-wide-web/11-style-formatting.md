# Style & Formatting

HTML allows us to add style to our pages internally, or inline, using HTML tags. Weâ€™ve already styled our pages a bit using the `<h1>` tag. `<h1>` designates preformatted text that is larger than the `<p>` or paragraph text. But, what if we want to add color or change the font on our page? 

```{image} ../images/ch5/Image_13.jpg
:alt: Style
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

We can add style to individual HTML element tags using `style` attributes. The syntax for style attributes is `style="STYLE_PROPERTY:PROPERTY_VALUE;"`

## Examples

For example, if we wanted text characters in the `H1` tag to be blue and center aligned:
```HTML
 <h1 style="color:blue; text-align:center;">Hello World!</h1>
```

And if we wanted text in the `p` tag to have a light blue background and a different font:
```HTML
 <p style="background-color:powderblue; font-family:courier;">This is my first HTML page.</p>
```

## Putting It All Together

All style elements are enclosed in quotation marks and include a semicolon after each element. To put that all together:

```HTML
<body>
 <h1 style="color:blue; text-align:center;">Hello World!</h1>
 <p style="background-color:powderblue; font-family:courier;">This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
```

```{image} ../images/ch5/Image_14.png
:alt: Style
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

We can see how the style attributes are changing how the web page content displays:
- The `<h1>` heading has has a blue text color and is center-aligned
- The `<p>` content has a powder blue background color and Courier font

If you haven't already, experiment with modifying your existing HTML pages to include some of these (or other) style elements.
