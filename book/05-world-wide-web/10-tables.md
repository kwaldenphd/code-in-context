# Building Tables

HTML uses a few core tags for web pages that include tables.
- `table` (marks the start and end of a table
- `tbody` (marks the start and end of the table body)
- `tr` (marks the start and end of each table row)
- `th` (marks the start and end of each column in the first row of the table)
- `td` (marks the start and end of each column after the first row of the table)

## Example

How we might see those tags combined in a table structure:

```HTML
<table>
 <tr>
  <th>First Column Header</th>
  <th>Second Column Header</th>
  <th>Third Column Header</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Data in first column/first row</td>
  <td>Data in second column/first row</td>
  <td>Data in third column/first row</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Data in first column/second row</td>
  <td>Data in second column/second row</td>
  <td>Data in third column/second row</td>
 </tr>
</table>
```

The output of that HTML would look like:

<table>
 <tr>
  <th>First Column Header</th>
  <th>Second Column Header</th>
  <th>Third Column Header</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Data in first column/first row</td>
  <td>Data in second column/first row</td>
  <td>Data in third column/first row</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Data in first column/second row</td>
  <td>Data in second column/second row</td>
  <td>Data in third column/second row</td>
 </tr>
</table>

Additional attributes like `align`, `style`, etc. can be used with many of these tags. For more on building tables in HTML:

## Application

Add a table to one of your HTML pages (index.html or page2.html). You could create fictional data or add meaningful data from another source.
