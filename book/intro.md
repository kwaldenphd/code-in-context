The work of the course includes discussions of content that foregrounds the cultural, social, and historical dimensions of computing technologies along with exploration and foundational skill building with various computing tools and methods.

This course is part of the College of Arts and Letters [Technology & Digital Studies Program](https://altech.nd.edu/). Visit the "[Background](background.md)" page for additional information about the course.
