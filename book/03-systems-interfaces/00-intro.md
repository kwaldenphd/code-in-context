# How Computers Work (Part 2): Operating Systems & Interfaces

This chapter covers a variety of topics related to how computers "work," with a focus on operating systems and computer interfaces.

One goal for this chapter is to help you gain an understanding of how the operating system and other software applications interact with the underlying hardware, focusing on common core operating system tasks. 

Finally, this chapter introduces the concept of a command-line interface and provides a foundation for navigating the machine using the shell.

The author consulted Chapter 10, "Operating Systems" from Nell Dale and John Lewis' *[Computer Science Illuminated, Seventh Edition](https://www.jblearning.com/catalog/productdetails/9781284155617)* textbook (Jones & Barlett Learning, 2020; ISBN: 9781284155617) when writing this lab.

The sections of this lab that involve working at the command line are based on and adapts content from the following tutorials:
- Ian Milligan and James Baker, "Introduction to the Bash Command Line," The Programming Historian 3 (2014), https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0037.
- Miriam Posner, "[Getting Started With Unix](https://github.com/miriamposner/unix/blob/main/getting_started_with_commandline.md)" tutorial

This lab's lecture segments were adapted from the following PBS *[Crash Course Computer Science](https://www.pbs.org/show/crash-course-computer-science/)* episodes:
- "[Operating Systems](https://www.pbs.org/video/operating-systems-crash-course-computer-science-18-wwc9c2/)"

- Framing questions:
  * What are some of the arguments McPherson makes about the significance of how computing history is narrated or framed? 
    * What does she say about perspectives that are typically highlighted or centered?
	* What does she say about contexts or perspectives that are typically ignored or marginalized?
  * Don't get too fixated on specific aspects of UNIX history. Instead, focus on the arguments McPerson makes about the values (or implications) embedded in traditional approaches to software development.
    * What design or development principles is she talking about?
	* What does she have to say about them?
