# Tutorial: Typing Commands in the Terminal

You may have already noticed you're not able to navigate the terminal using your mouse or cursor. We can navigate the terminal using the keyboard. The `up` and `down` arrow keys let you move back (up) and forward (down) through previously typed commands. The `left` and `right` arrow keys let you move within characters or symbols for a specific command.

Press the `up` arrow once to show the previously-typed `echo` command. Then, use the `left` and `right` arrow keys to navigate to the characters within the quotation marks and replace them with another word or phrase of your choosing. Press `Return` or `Enter` to run the modified command. 

A couple other useful navigation tools:
- Press `Control` + `A` to move to the start of a line
- Press `Control` + `E` to move to the end of a line
- Type `clear` into the terminal and press `Return`/`Enter` to clear the screen
- When you're ready to close the terminal window, type `exit` and press `Return`/`Enter`

A couple notes on terminal syntax:
- `commands` tell the computer to perform an action 
- `options` modify the command and use a hyphen (`-`) symbol
  * Sometimes `options` are called `flags` or `switches`
- `arguments` specify what the command operation will be performed on (i.e. a specific file or directory)

Not all commands require arguments or options, but some commands can have one or more of each. You can also chain multiple commands together using the vertical bar `|` symbol. This is often called a `pipe`.
