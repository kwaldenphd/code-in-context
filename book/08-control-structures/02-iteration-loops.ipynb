This is usually expressed with keywords such as `while`, `repeat`, `for`, or `do..until`. The basic attribute of an iteration control structure is to be able to repeat some lines of code. The visual display of iteration creates a circular loop pattern when flowcharted, thus the word 'loop' is associated with iteration control structures.\"\n","\n","Let's break down that definition:\n","- Iteration (repetition of a process) is a type of control structure\n","- In programming languages, iteration involves lines of code repeating until a condition is met of the end of a group of values has been reached.\n","- Because iteration in this context involves a circular pattern, many object-oriented programming languages refer to these structures as `loops`\n","\n","```{admonition} Additional Resources\n",":class: tip, dropdown\n","For more on the technical foundations of iteration in Python:\n","- W3Schools, \"[Python Iterators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_iterators.asp)\"\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"bjIKUKVEmXcO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Iteration in Python\n","\n","We've actually already seen iteration in action."],"metadata":{"id":"FWD0061v7Ybh"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# create string variable\n","message = \"Hello world!\"\n","\n","# return number of characters in string\n","len(message)\n","\n","# test if character x is in string\n","'x' in message # returns false\n","\n","# test if symbol % is NOT in string\n","'%' not in message # returns true"],"metadata":{"id":"Thlyy-KwFmdR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1666292433693,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":259,"user":{"displayName":"Katherine Walden","userId":"17094108395123900917"}},"outputId":"d5bffc5d-db55-474f-e99e-ff0ee090d1f8","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["These membership tests (using `in` and `not in`) involve iteration- the program goes left-to-right, starting at the first character in the string.
