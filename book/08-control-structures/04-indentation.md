# Indentation

As we continue to introduce more programming concepts and further our work in Python, we're starting to see **code blocks** and **indentation** at work.

From Busbee and Braunschweig's "[Code Blocks](https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/code-blocks/)" from *Programming Fundamentals*:
- "A code block, sometimes referred to as a compound statement, is a lexical structure of source code which is grouped together. Blocks consist of one or more declarations and statements. A programming language that permits the creation of blocks, including blocks nested within other blocks, is called a block-structured programming language. Blocks are fundamental to structured programming, where control structures are formed from blocks."
   
In Python syntax, code blocks are marked by indentation, or indented lines of code.
