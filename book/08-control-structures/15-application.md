## Application Questions


Q1: Write a program that asks a user to enter a color value and returns an output message comparing that value with your favorite color. This program will use a combination of the `input()` function, comparison operators, and `if-then-else` logic. Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

Sample output for this program:
```
Your favorite color: green

My age: blue

We don't have the same favorite color.
```

Q2: Write a program that lets the user play a guessing game.
- First, your program should set a number as the "correct answer"
- Then, your program will ask the user to guess a number
- Your program should give a message indicating whether the user's guess is correct, too high, or too low

This program will use a combination of the `input()` function, comparison operators, and `if-then-else` logic. Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

Sample output for this program (for a correct answer of 7:
```
You guessed 13.
```

Q3: Return to your Q1 color guessing game program. Rewrite the program to use a `whlie` statement and continue until the user guesses your favorite color. This program will use a combination of the `input()` function, comparison operators, a `while` statement, and `if-then-else` logic. Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

Q4: Write a program that lets the user play a guessing game.
- First, your program should set a number as the "correct answer"
- Then, your program will ask the user to guess a number
- Your program should give a message indicating whether the user's guess is correct, too high, or too low

This program will use a combination of the `input()` function, comparison operators, and `if-then-else` logic. Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

Sample output for this program (for a correct answer of 7:
```
You guessed 13.
```

Q5: Given the following program:

```Python
# assign count variable
count = 1

# while loop
while count <= 5: # initial condition
   print ("Python") # print statement
   count = count + 1 # reassign count

# final print statement
print ("Done")
```

How would you modify the program to print or output the string nine (9) times and also include line numbers as part of the output? Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

For example, your output might look like the following:

```
1 Python
2 Python
3 Python
4 Python
5 Python
6 Python
7 Python
8 Python
9 Python
IS FUN!
```

Q6: Let's return to the previous question's program. How would you modify your program to use a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop? Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

As a reminder, your output might look like the following:

```
1 Python
2 Python
3 Python
4 Python
5 Python
6 Python
7 Python
8 Python
9 Python
IS FUN!
```

Q7: An earlier application question asked you to modify the program below to search for the characters `q` and `u` in the string `turquoise`.

```Python# assign string variable
color = "turquoise"

# get index number of t character
index_number = color.index("t")

# show index number as part of print statement
print ("The index number for the letter t within the word " + color + " is " + index_number)
```

Write a program that uses a `for` loop to return all instances of `q` and `u` in the string, not just the first occurrence. Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

Q8: Write a program that asks the user to enter three numbers: a starting value, an ending value, and an increment. Your program should then "count" based on these criteria, as shown in the sample output below. Answer to this question includes programs with a `while` loop and a `for` loop + comments that document process and explain your code.

```
This program counts for you.
Enter the starting value: 3
Enter the ending value: 13
Enter the increment: 2
3
5
7
9
11
13
```

Q9: Write a program that prints the numbers 1 through 10, except that between 7 and 8 it should print the word "happy." Answer to this question includes programs with a `while` loop and a `for` loop + comments that document process and explain your code.

Sample output for this program:
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
happy
8
9
10
```

HINT: How could an `if` statement be helpful to achieve this output?
