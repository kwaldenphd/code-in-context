# Putting It All Together

NOTE: For the following application questions, write two programs for each- one that uses a `while` loop and one that uses a `for` loop to accomplish the same task.

## Question 7

Q7: Write a program that asks the user to enter three numbers: a starting value, an ending value, and an increment. Your program should then "count" based on these criteria, as shown in the sample output below. Answer to this question includes programs with a `while` loop and a `for` loop + comments that document process and explain your code.

```
This program counts for you.
Enter the starting value: 3
Enter the ending value: 13
Enter the increment: 2
3
5
7
9
11
13
```

## Question 8

Q8: Write a program that prints the numbers 1 through 10, except that between 7 and 8 it should print the word "happy." Answer to this question includes programs with a `while` loop and a `for` loop + comments that document process and explain your code.

Sample output for this program:
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
happy
8
9
10
```

How could an `if` statement be helpful to achieve this output?
