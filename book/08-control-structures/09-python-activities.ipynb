If others could go to a place of natural beauty and write a poem about that place, why couldn't I write a poetry generator, instead? Less esoteric than much of my other work, and aimed at evocative description rather than provocation or parody, this generator forms strophes that begin and end with a \"path\" line and may have one or more more static \"site\" lines in between. Between each pair of such strophes is a \"cave\" line that trails off, as if into darkness, like the tunnels in the park that were carved by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist army. The generated text, which is produced limitlessly, is pleasing to read, perhaps, but it seems at least as enjoyable to carve into the code and shape the program to represent different experiences and ideas.”</blockquote>\n",

We can create his algorithm in Python using list methods, a few different flavors of iteration, and conditional statements (along with a lot of concatenation and work with strings). The program below is based on [Allison Parrish’s implementation](https://github.com/aparrish/rwet/blob/master/some-poetry-generators.ipynb), but you can modify the original text and output format to make your own creation!\n",
