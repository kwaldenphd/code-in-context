From Busbee and Braunschweig's "[Iteration Control Structures](https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/iteration-control-structures/)," in *Programming Fundamentals*:

"In iteration control structures, a statement or block is executed until the program reaches a certain state, or operations have been applied to every element of a collection. This is usually expressed with keywords such as `while`, `repeat`, `for`, or `do..until`. The basic attribute of an iteration control structure is to be able to repeat some lines of code. The visual display of iteration creates a circular loop pattern when flowcharted, thus the word 'loop' is associated with iteration control structures."

Let's break down that definition:
- Iteration (repetition of a process) is a type of control structure
- In programming languages, iteration involves lines of code repeating until a condition is met of the end of a group of values has been reached.
- Because iteration in this context involves a circular pattern, many object-oriented programming languages refer to these structures as `loops`
