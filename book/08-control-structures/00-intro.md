# Control Structures in Python
 
According to Busbee and Braunschweig's "[Structured Programming](https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/structured-programming/)" *Programming Fundamentals*, "One of the most important concepts of programming is the ability to control a program so that different lines of code are executed or that some lines of code are executed many times. The mechanisms that allow us to control the flow of execution are called control structures. Flowcharting is a method of documenting (charting) the flow (or paths) that a program would execute. There are three main categories of control structures:"
  * Sequence [executes in given sequence]
  * Selection [selects between two or more flows using condition or question]
  * Iteration [repeats same piece of code multiple times]
  
This chapter provides an introduction to control structures in the Python programming langauge. Topics covered include:
- Control flow and control structures
- Event-controlled and count-controlled loops
- Looping structures in Python (`for` and `while`)
