Q1a: Let's use the `ping` command for a network test. Open a terminal shell (`Terminal` or `Git BASH`). Type `ping` followed by an IP address. A few you could choose from:
- OpenDNS: `208.67.222.222` and `208.67.220.220`
- Cloudflare: `1.1.1.1` and `1.0.0.1`
- Google: `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`

Sample command for Google:
```
ping 8.8.8.8
```

Press `Enter`/`Return`.

Q1b: Describe what you're seeing in the `ping` command output. What do these results indicate about the network status? A couple resources that can help with understanding these results:
- IBM, "[`ping` Command](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.1?topic=p-ping-command)"
- PageDuty, "[How to Ping a Network for Testing Connectivity](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/learn/ping-network-testing-connectivity/)"

Q2a: Let's run a similar test using the `traceroute` or `tracert` command. Still in the  terminal, type `tracert` followed by a domain name or IP address.

Domain name example:
```
tracert google.com
```

IP address example:
```
tracert 8.8.8.8
```

Press `Enter`/`Return`.

Q2b: Describe what you're seeing in the `traceroute`/`tracert` program output. What do these results indicate about the network status? How are they similar or different from the `ping` output? 

A couple resources that can help with understanding these results:
- RedHat, "[Traceroute: Finding meaning among the stars](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/traceroute-finding-meaning)"
- InMotion Hosting, "[How to Read a Traceroute](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/server/ssh/read-traceroute/)"

Q3a: Let's use the `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac) commands to learn more about your computer's network configuration. Open a terminal shell (`Terminal` or `Git BASH`). Type `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac) followed by `Enter`/`Return`.

Q3b: Describe what you're seeing in the output. What information are these results providing about your network? How do they connect to concepts covered in this lab?
