## <i class="fa-solid fa-globe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Background

From [Network Lands](http://networks.land/activities/i-think-therefore-icann/):
<blockquote>
This is a very didactic, very silly game for understanding the weird politics that has previously happened and continues to happen behind the scenes of top-level domains, or that thing you put at the end of a URL in a browser. Probably better suited to older players, not necessarily for content but maybe more just because of the sheer degree of abstraction entailed.
<br>
Domain names are where the politics, poetics, and peculiarities of the web express themselves in often the most direct and clever ways. But even the most active domain name hoarder might not really understand how the Domain Name System works, why certain TLDs exist, and how they at times become an arena where real-world geopolitical conflicts play out online. This game is meant to walk players through some of those realities.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-gears" aria-hidden="true"></i> Setup

Players have 3 role options:
- Country-code top-level domain (ccTLD)
- General top-level domain (gTLD)
- Secessionist region (seeking a TLD)

Each player needs the appropriate scorecard and writing utensil. Each group needs a set of playing cards and six-sided dice.
- DO NOT look at the playing cards.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-medal" aria-hidden="true"></i> Goal

Each player's goal is to earn and maintain 500 points so they can acquire a TLD, acquire additional TLDs, and/or prevent the loss of a TLD.

```{admonition} Participant Handout & Instructions
:class: tip, dropdown
[Link to Google Doc](http://bit.ly/icann-dns-game) with instructions for participants.
```

Start:
- Each player rolls the 6-sided dice and multiplies that value by 100 for your starting point value.
- The cTLD and gTLD players each have 1 TLD when the game starts.
- Playing order is determined by the starting point values (highest starting value draws first).

Rounds:
- Each round, cTLD and gTLD players get a scarcity bonus. This bonus is calculated by rolling the 6-sided dice and multiplying that value by 10.
- Whoever is first in the playing order draws one of their cards and follows the instructions.
  * Refer to the [playing card Google Sheet](https://bit.ly/icann-scenario-cards) or [Networks Land web page](http://networks.land/activities/i-think-therefore-icann/) for additional details and real-world examples that explain the playing card scenarios.
- Once a secessionist region purchases a TLD, they start playing as a gTLD.
