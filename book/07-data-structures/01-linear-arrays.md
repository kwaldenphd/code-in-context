"In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key...The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array" ([Wikipedia, "Array (data structure)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure))")

We can think of arrays as one-dimensional, linear data structures made up of a collection of items. As the definitions note, we can access specific elements in the array by using an index or key value.

These **one-dimensional or linear array structures** have a few key properties that differentiate the structures and shape how we can interact with or manipulate them in a programming environment.

Those properties include:
- Mutable: Can values in the structure be changed once it has been created or assigned to a variable?
- Order: Does the order of values in the structure have meaning/significance, or is order not significant?
- Indexing/Slicing: Can values in the structure be accessed using their position or index? Can we isolate values in the structure using their position?
- Duplicates: Does the structure allow duplicate values?
