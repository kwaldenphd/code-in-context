# Binary Number Systems & Encoding Schema

How do computers understand information? What makes user actions decipherable for the machine? This chapter explores those concepts, looking at binary code, the 1’s and 0’s that represent the bits and bytes that make up computer programs or the data processed by the computer.

Nearly everything we interact with on a computer screen can be reduced to binary code, although most users of computers have few reasons to interact with the computer at this level. This chapter's lets you manipulate binary data, providing an opportunity to further explore the relationship between what you seen on the screen and what is going on inside the machine.

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:
-	Calculate the value of bytes using binary addition
-	Explain how text and color are represented in binary
-	Use a hex editor to manipulate binary code
-	Define the relationship between the logical, physical, and conceptual facets of a digital object

- Framing questions:
  * As you read, be thinking about how the article presents coding- what does it include, who is it for? You can also be thinking about how the coding education experiences Richtel describes connect to your own ideas or experiences around computing.

- Framing questions:
  * Catholic Social Teaching concepts may be new to some of us, and that's okay! As you skim, be thinking about how this article describes digital technologies, especially the human dimensions of how technologies work and are used. You can also be thinking about a vision of digital technology that promotes human dignity and the common good- what stands out to you about these possibilities?
